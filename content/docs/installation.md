# Installation

This guide covers the minimal setup needed to use `timetable-sa` in a Node.js or
TypeScript project. The package is runtime-light, but it assumes you are
working in a modern JavaScript environment that supports the current Node.js
ecosystem.

## Requirements

You need the following baseline environment:

- Node.js `18+` or a compatible Bun runtime,
- a TypeScript project if you want full type inference and generic state safety,
- an application-level module system compatible with modern package exports.

## Install from npm

Install the package from npm.

```bash
npm install timetable-sa
```

## Import the public API

After installation, import the solver and the public types you need.

```ts
import { SimulatedAnnealing } from 'timetable-sa';
import type {
  Constraint,
  MoveGenerator,
  SAConfig,
  Solution,
  ProgressStats,
} from 'timetable-sa';
```

## Runtime notes

Several operational details are useful to know before integration.

- `solve()` is asynchronous and returns `Promise<Solution<TState>>`.
- if you use `onProgress`, the default `onProgressMode` is `'await'`, so slow
  callbacks can reduce throughput,
- file logging with `logging.output: 'file' | 'both'` creates parent
  directories automatically,
- move generators receive a solver-provided clone, so they may mutate the state
  passed into `generate(...)`.

## Recommended next step

Once installation is complete, continue to `quickstart.md` for a minimal
end-to-end solver example.
